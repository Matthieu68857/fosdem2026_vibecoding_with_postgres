Please generate a fancy modern dashboard that documents my entire database.
I need a visual diagram showing how the tables are related, followed by a detailed breakdown of every table's structure with some real sample data.
Also, please start with a system health overview. Check the database stats and metrics to give me a summary of its current state, highlighting anything interesting or concerning like table bloat or heavily used connections.
Lastly, I want a deep dive on the configuration of the Postgres instance (sizing, parameters, extensions, etc.)
